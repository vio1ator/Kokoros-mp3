Give a star if you like it!


[Kokoro](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) is a trending top 2 TTS model on huggingface.
This repo provides **insanely fast Kokoro infer in Rust**, you can now have your built TTS engine powered by Kokoro and infer fast by only a command of `koko`.

`kokoros` is a `rust` crate that provides easy to use TTS ability.
One can directly call `koko` in terminal to synthesize audio.

`kokoros` uses a relative small model 87M params, while results in extremly good quality voices results.

Languge support:

- [X] English;
- [X] Chinese (partly);
- [X] Japanese (partly);
- [X] German (partly);

> 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Kokoros Rust version just got a lot attention now. If you also interested in insanely fast inference, embeded build, wasm support etc, please star this repo! We are keep updating it.

> Currently help wanted! Implement OpenAI compatible API in Rust, anyone interested? Send me PR!

## Updates

- ***`2025.01.22`***: 🔥🔥🔥 **Streaming mode supported.** You can now using `--steam` to have fun with stream mode, kudos to [mroigo](https://github.com/mrorigo);
- ***`2025.01.17`***: 🔥🔥🔥 Style mixing supported! Now, listen the output AMSR effect by simply specific style: `af_sky.4+af_nicole.5`;
- ***`2025.01.15`***: OpenAI compatible server supported, openai format still under polish!
- ***`2025.01.15`***: Phonemizer supported! Now `Kokoros` can inference E2E without anyother dependencies! Kudos to [@tstm](https://github.com/tstm);
- ***`2025.01.13`***: Espeak-ng tokenizer and phonemizer supported! Kudos to [@mindreframer](https://github.com/mindreframer) ;
- ***`2025.01.12`***: Released `Kokoros`;

## Installation

1. Initialize voice data:

```bash
python scripts/fetch_voices.py
```

This step fetches the required `voices.json` data file, which is necessary for voice synthesis.

2. Build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Test the installation:

```bash
cargo run
```

For production use:

```bash
./target/release/koko -h        # View available options
./target/release/koko -t "Hello, this is a TTS test"
```

The generated audio will be saved to:

```
tmp/output.wav
```

### OpenAI-Compatible Server

1. Start the server:

```bash
cargo run -- --oai
```

2. Make API requests using either curl or Python:

Using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "tts-1",
    "input": "Hello, this is a test of the Kokoro TTS system!",
    "voice": "af_sky"
  }'
```

Using Python:

```bash
python scripts/run_openai.py
```

## Roadmap

Due to Kokoro actually not finalizing it's ability, this repo will keep tracking the status of Kokoro, and helpfully we can have language support incuding: English, Mandarin, Japanese, German, French etc.
